This is a language package for Atom that provides support for editing
[LiveCode](http://livecode.com/) source code.

LiveCode is an open source platform provides a way to build applications for
mobile, desktop and server platforms. The visual workflow allows the user to
develop apps "live", using a powerful and uniquely-accessible language syntax.

The LiveCode server syntax and revIgniter snippets were converted from the
TextMate bundles available from the [revIgniter](http://revigniter.com/)
website.

## Supported languages

Currently, this package supports editing:

* LiveCode Builder source code in `.lcb` files
* LiveCode server source code in `.lc` and `.irev` files

The package provides syntax highlighting, highlighting and indentation support
for all the supported languages.

It also provides snippets to enhance LiveCode server script and revIgniter
script development.

## Installation

Install the `language-livecode` package from the "Install Packages and Themes"
view in Atom's "Settings" window.

You may also wish to install the [revIgniter theme](https://atom.io/themes/revigniter-syntax)
for Atom.
